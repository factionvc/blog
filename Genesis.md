They say that writing is one of the best ways to organize your thoughts. And selfishly, learning in public compounds the effects of that process. So with that, it is our great pleasure to introduce the Faction.vc technical blog. 

The aim of these writings and essays is to share our perspective on the web3 universe as it grows and evolves so that you, dear reader, can get inside our heads a little bit, and share our vantage. If you're building, and find it useful or have constructive feedback, please let us know. Open sourcing our knowledge for the greater good is what it's all about.

### But first, a little about Faction

Faction.vc is the early stage crypto/web3 fund that came out of [Lightspeed Venture Partners](https://lsvp.com) in July. We love projects that already have something in market, but are still early enough where we can add meaningful value. Specifically;

* technically
* token economics
* recruiting
* marketing
* go-to-market
* pricing strategy
* access to international markets
* access to the Lightspeed platform

All of us have been in crypto through multiple bear markets, either investing or building. We're genuinely passionate about seeing the space grow and realizing it's full potential. We're here because we're shameless idealists, believing that a better future is possible - but also enamoured by the technology.

In the spirit of transparency, and all these writings being living documents as our perspectives change, you can see the full commit history for this blog on [Github](https://github.com/factionvc/blog)

### And, a little about the author

By way of introduction to [myself](https://linkedin.com/in/hdahme), I'm the Technical Partner at the firm. The shorter version is that I spent some years in AI, cloud computing, and gaming before backing into crypto via impact investing and starting an undercollateralized lending platform before there was DeFi. 

All of those projects failed as startups do, but along the way I created a decentralized credit scoring platform and a decentralized counterparty risk engine. Coinbase picked that up, where I spent some years jamming on DID and leading a regulatory response team. Eventually I ran the humanitarian aid and climate practices of the Coinbase Giving program, as well as spent a lot of time with Coinbase Ventures as their engineer in residence.

I'm a generalist by nature, having done everything from engineering and product management, to smart contract and SRE work, but there is a lot I don't know (including how to write beautiful React and Rust), so I'm excited to put my naïveté and ignorance on display.

There's a non-zero probability that we'll run into each other skiing, mountain biking, or drinking Molsons :flag-ca: 

Onwards :raised_hands::tada:
